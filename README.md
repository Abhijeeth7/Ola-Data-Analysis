**1. Project Overview**

This project involves an in-depth data analysis of OLA booking data to extract meaningful insights that can help improve service efficiency, customer satisfaction, and operational performance. By leveraging Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and manipulation, and SQL for querying, along with Power BI for interactive visualizations, this analysis aims to transform raw booking information into actionable intelligence.

**Goal**: To identify key trends, operational bottlenecks, customer behavior patterns, and cancellation reasons to support data-driven decision-making for OLA.

**2. Business Questions & Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are to answer critical business questions related to ride bookings, cancellations, customer and driver behavior, and operational metrics.

**SQL Analysis Questions**:

**The following insights were extracted using SQL queries on the cleaned dataset**:

Retrieve all successful bookings.

Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type.

Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.

List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides.

Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues.

Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.

Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI.

Find the average customer rating per vehicle type.

Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully.

List all incomplete rides along with the reason.

Power BI Visualization Objectives:

The following dashboards and visualizations were created using Power BI to present insights interactively:

Ride Volume Over Time

Booking Status Breakdown

Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance

Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type

Cancelled Rides Reasons (by Customer and Driver)

Revenue by Payment Method

Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value

Ride Distance Distribution Per Day

Driver Ratings Distribution

Customer vs. Driver Ratings

**3. Dataset**

The project utilizes a dataset containing OLA ride booking information. The dataset includes 100,000 entries with 20 columns providing details about dates, times, booking specifics, customer and driver information, ride metrics, and cancellation details.

**Key Columns**:

**Date**: Date of the booking.

**Time**: Time of the booking (24-hour format).

**Booking_ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.

**Booking_Status**: Status of the booking (e.g., Success, Cancelled by Customer, Cancelled by Driver, Incomplete).

**Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.

**Vehicle_Type**: Type of vehicle booked (e.g., Mini, Auto, Prime SUV).

**Pickup_Location**: Location where the ride started.

**Drop_Location**: Location where the ride ended.

**VTAT**: Vehicle Turnaround Time (Average).

**CTAT**: Customer Turnaround Time (Average).

**cancelled_Rides_by_Customer**: Count of rides cancelled by the customer.

**Reason_for_cancelling_by_Customer**: Reason provided by the customer for cancellation.

**cancelled_Rides_by_Driver**: Count of rides cancelled by the driver.

**Reason_for_cancelling_by_Driver**: Reason provided by the driver for cancellation.

**Incomplete_Rides**: Count of incomplete rides.

**Incomplete_Rides_Reason**: Reason for incomplete ride.

**Booking_Value**: Monetary value of the booking.

**Payment_Method**: Method used for payment (e.g., UPI, Cash).

**Ride_Distance**: Distance covered during the ride.

**Driver_Ratings**: Ratings given by customers to drivers.

**Customer_Rating**: Ratings given by drivers to customers.

**4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

The initial dataset required significant cleaning to ensure data quality and integrity for analysis. **The following steps were performed**:

**Handling Missing Values**:

Avg VTAT, Avg CTAT, Ride Distance, Driver Ratings, Customer Rating: Null values were imputed using the mean of their respective columns, as their distributions were relatively symmetric.

**Booking Value**: Null values were imputed using the median due to its skewed distribution, providing a more robust central tendency measure.

Cancelled Rides by Customer, Cancelled Rides by Driver, Incomplete Rides: Null values were imputed with 0, as a null typically indicates that the event (cancellation/incompletion) did not occur for that ride.

Reason for cancelling by Customer, Reason for cancelling by Driver, Incomplete Rides Reason: Null values were imputed with the string 'Not Applicable', indicating no reason was recorded because the corresponding event did not happen.

**Data Type Conversion**: Ensured Date and Time columns were parsed correctly for database import.

**Data Consistency**: Addressed minor inconsistencies where necessary (e.g., specific Payment_Method entries, though not detailed in the provided df.info output, were assumed to be handled based on project requirements).

**5. Analysis & Insights (SQL Questions)**

SQL queries were executed against the cleaned dataset (imported into MySQL) to derive specific insights. The .sql files in the sql_queries/ directory contain the precise queries used to answer the business questions listed in Section 2.

**7. Visualizations (Power BI Questions)
**
Interactive dashboards and reports were developed in Power BI to visually represent the findings and facilitate exploration. The Power BI .pbix file is located in the powerbi_reports/ directory. These visualizations address the objectives outlined in Section 2, providing a dynamic view of the data.

**9. Tools & Technologies**

**The following tools and libraries were used in this project**:

**Data Manipulation & Cleaning**:

**Python**: Programming language

**Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library

**NumPy**: Numerical computing library

**Microsoft Excel**: Initial data inspection and manual corrections (as per user's description).

**Database**:

**MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing and querying data.

**MySQL Workbench**: Graphical tool for managing MySQL databases and importing data.

**Business Intelligence & Visualization**:

**Microsoft Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and reports.

**Version Control**:

**Git**: Distributed version control system.

**GitHub**: Web-based platform for Git repositories.

**9. How to Use**
  
**To explore this project**:

**Clone the repository**:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Abhijeeth7/Ola-Data-Analysis.git cd Ola-Data-Analysis

**Data Preparation (Python)**:

Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (pandas, numpy) installed.

Open main.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).

Run all cells to perform data cleaning and generate booking_data_cleaned.csv.

**Database Setup (MySQL)**:

Set up a MySQL server.

Use MySQL Workbench's Data Import Wizard to import OLA_Booking_Data/booking_data_cleaned.csv into a new table (e.g., booking_data).

Ensure nullable columns in your SQL schema match the data (e.g., Avg VTAT should be nullable if it has missing values).

**SQL Analysis**:

Connect to your MySQL database using MySQL Workbench or another SQL client.

Execute the queries found in sql_queries/analyze_bookings.sql to retrieve insights.

**Power BI Visualizations**:

Open powerbi_reports/OLA_Dashboard.pbix with Power BI Desktop.

Refresh the data source connection (you might need to point it to your MySQL table if it's not automatically linked).

Explore the interactive dashboards.

**10. Future Enhancements**

**Advanced Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict ride cancellations or driver availability.

**Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize pickup/drop-off coordinates (if available) for more detailed route optimization or demand hot-spot analysis.

**Real-time Data Integration**: Explore streaming data analysis for live operational insights.

**Customer Segmentation**: Perform advanced clustering to identify different customer segments based on their booking patterns.
